"""``_await_worker_results`` orchestration logic.

The validator spawns one process per virtual rank. When a rank hits an
exception it ships an error payload and exits cleanly, but a peer blocked in a
collective never gets its partner and hangs. The wait loop must detect that
asymmetric crash and return immediately (with the crashed rank's payload)
instead of blocking the whole timeout and reporting a bare "timed out". These
tests drive the pure loop with fake processes and an injected clock — no real
multiprocessing — so the four terminal states are covered fast and on CPU.
