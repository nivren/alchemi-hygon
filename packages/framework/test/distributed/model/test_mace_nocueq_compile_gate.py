"""Non-cueq MACE + ``torch.compile`` DD gate: force equivalence (via the
per-interaction halo hook) AND zero steady-state recompiles.

The non-cueq compiled-DD path is a *structurally different* compiled path from
the cueq gates (``test_compile_recompile_gate.py``,
``test_mace_cueq_compile_gate.py``): non-cueq MACE runs e3nn's
``@torch.jit.script`` ``ScriptModule`` layers, which Dynamo cannot trace
(``UnspecializedNNModuleVariable wrapped around ScriptModules unsupported``), so
the forward fragments into ~20 graphs. The halo ghost refresh therefore CANNOT
use the compile-refresh graph pass: with the forward fragmented, each
interaction's message ``scatter_add`` lands in its own tiny graph whose only
inputs are ``edge_index`` + node features (no routing) — routing threaded at the
top frame can't cross the ScriptModule breaks into those fragments, so the pass
inserts zero corrections (measured). The refresh must instead ride
:func:`~nvalchemi.models.mace._install_mace_halo_fix`, the hook wrapped *inside*
each ``interaction.forward`` that corrects at the interaction *output* (back in
the wrapper frame, where routing is a live closure cell) — sidestepping the
fragmentation entirely.

This gate guards exactly that hook:

* **Equivalence** (a fixed *jittered* geometry — a perfect lattice has ~zero net
  force, which would make the comparison vacuous): an *eager*-DD reference (same
  ``DistributedModel`` path, no compile) vs the compiled DD forward on the same
  partition — each rank's owned forces must match. The cell is **elongated**
  along the partition axis so the partition is genuinely non-degenerate
  (``atoms`` cap < total atoms): a cubic 2-rank box has a ghost layer spanning
  the half-slab, so every rank sees every atom and the refresh is a near-no-op.
  Here a disabled/broken refresh leaves stale ghosts that perturb owned forces by
  ~3e-5 — far above the tol and the ~1e-12 fp64 compile noise the working hook
  leaves. Verified sensitive: the assertion FAILS under
  ``NVALCHEMI_MACE_NO_REFRESH=1`` (refresh off) and passes with it on.
* **Recompiles** (jittered MD loop): after warmup the number of unique compiled
  graphs (``torch._dynamo.utils.counters["stats"]["unique_graphs"]``) must not
  grow. The graph count is large (per-fragment) but the framework COO
  fixed-shape caps must hold it *stable* across steps.

Requires 2+ CUDA GPUs + ``mace-torch`` installed. cuequivariance is NOT used.
