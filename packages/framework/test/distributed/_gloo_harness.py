"""Reusable Gloo-spawn helpers for distributed-dispatch tests.

Centralises the boilerplate of:

  - ``mp.spawn`` with a generic worker that calls a user-supplied test
    function under an initialised gloo process group on CPU.
  - A monkey-patch of
    ``physicsnemo.distributed.utils.indexed_all_to_all_v_wrapper`` so the
    halo-exchange primitives have a working ``all_to_all_v`` over gloo
    (NCCL has it natively but gloo doesn't).
  - A queue-backed mechanism for collecting per-rank results back to
    the launcher process. Useful for asserts of the form "rank 0 saw
    shape X, rank 1 saw shape Y".

Patterns
--------
A test that just needs all_reduce (per_system_reduce) does::

    def _check(rank, world_size, queue):
        from nvalchemi.distributed._core.dispatch_trace import dispatch_trace
        with dispatch_trace() as records:
            ...
        queue.put((rank, records))

    def test_thing():
        records_per_rank = run_gloo(world_size=2, fn=_check)
        # records_per_rank is a list of (rank, payload) tuples.

For tests that exercise the halo-exchange / sharded-gather paths,
``run_gloo`` already installs the gloo-friendly ``indexed_all_to_all_v``
shim in each worker — no per-test setup needed.
