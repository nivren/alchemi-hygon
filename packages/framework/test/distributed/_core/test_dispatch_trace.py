"""Tests for the dispatch-trace mechanism.

Single-process tests — they assert the API contract (record/no-record
based on context, record fields, scope nesting) without needing a
distributed process group. Multi-rank Gloo tests that exercise the
actual handlers live in ``test_dispatch_trace_gloo.py``.
