"""Shared multi-GPU process-group harness for the distributed model tests.

The real-model DD tests each spawn ``world_size`` processes that share a NCCL
group (rank ``r`` pinned to physical ``cuda:r``). This module centralises the
otherwise-duplicated init/teardown so a test only supplies its per-rank worker
function. It lives beside :mod:`_helpers` in ``test/distributed`` so both the
top-level and ``model/`` test packages can ``from _dd_harness import ...``."""

    A hardcoded port only separates test *files*; two concurrent runs of the

    and fail with ``EADDRINUSE``. Asking the OS for an unused port each time
    removes that coupling.

        The port number, as ``init_process_group`` wants it.
