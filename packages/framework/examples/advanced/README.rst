Advanced Examples
=================

These examples are for users who want to extend the nvalchemi-toolkit
framework.  They require understanding of the intermediate tier.

**01 — Biased Potential**: BiasedPotentialHook for harmonic COM restraints
and umbrella sampling patterns.

**02 — Custom Hook**: Implementing the Hook protocol with a full
radial distribution function accumulator.

**03 — Custom Convergence**: ConvergenceHook with multiple criteria and
custom_op for arbitrary convergence logic.

**04 — MACE NVT**: Using a real MACE MLIP for NVT dynamics; automatic
neighbor list wiring via ModelConfig; LJ fallback for CI.

**05 — Custom Integrator**: Subclassing BaseDynamics to implement a
velocity-rescaling thermostat; the pre_update/post_update contract;
_init_state for stateful integrators.

**07 — Composable Model Composition**: Combining LJ + Ewald models with
the ``+`` operator; PipelineModelWrapper for dependent pipelines.

**08 — AIMNet2 + Ewald Pipeline**: Composing AIMNet2 with Ewald
electrostatics and DFTD3 dispersion in a multi-group pipeline.

**09 — UMA NVE/NVT**: Driving the fairchem UMA foundation model through
NVE / NVT dynamics with energy-drift tracking; OMat crystals and OMol
molecules via task selection on ``UMAWrapper.from_checkpoint``.

**10 — MACE Training**: Training a ScaleShiftMACE model with the ALCHEMI
training stack; Zarr dataloading, scheduled Huber losses, EMA, checkpointing,
validation, and distributed launch patterns.
