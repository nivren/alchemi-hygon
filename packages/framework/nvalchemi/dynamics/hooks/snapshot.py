Snapshot hook for saving batch state to a data sink.

Provides :class:`SnapshotHook`, which periodically writes the full batch
state to a :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.sinks.DataSink` (GPU buffer, host
memory, or Zarr store).

class SnapshotHook:
    """Save a snapshot of the active batch to a :class:`DataSink` at a given frequency.

    This hook writes the **full** batch state — positions, velocities,
    forces, energy, and any other tensors present on the
    :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` — to the configured sink every
    ``frequency`` steps.  It is the primary mechanism for recording
    trajectories and creating restart checkpoints during dynamics runs.

    The hook delegates serialization entirely to the
    :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.sinks.DataSink` interface, meaning the
    same ``SnapshotHook`` instance works with any backend:

    * :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.sinks.GPUBuffer` — pre-allocated
      device memory for high-speed, in-simulation buffering.
    * :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.sinks.HostMemory` — CPU-resident
      list-of-:class:`AtomicData` storage, useful for staging before
      disk I/O.
    * :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.sinks.ZarrData` — persistent,
      Zarr-backed storage with CSR-style layout for variable-length
      graph data; supports local, in-memory, and remote (S3/GCS)
      stores.

    ``SnapshotHook`` fires at :attr:`~DynamicsStage.AFTER_STEP` — after all integrator
    updates, force clamping, and convergence checks have completed —
    guaranteeing that the snapshot reflects the fully resolved state
    for each recorded step.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sink : DataSink
        The storage backend to write snapshots to.
    frequency : int, optional
        Write a snapshot every ``frequency`` steps. Default ``1``
        (every step).

    Attributes
    ----------
    sink : DataSink
        The storage backend.
    frequency : int
        Snapshot frequency in steps.
    stage : DynamicsStage
        Fixed to ``AFTER_STEP``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from nvalchemi.dynamics.hooks import SnapshotHook
    >>> from nvalchemi.dynamics.sinks import HostMemory
    >>> sink = HostMemory(capacity=10_000)
    >>> hook = SnapshotHook(sink=sink, frequency=10)
    >>> dynamics = DemoDynamics(model=model, n_steps=1000, dt=0.5, hooks=[hook])
    >>> dynamics.run(batch)  # 100 snapshots written
    >>> trajectory = sink.read()

    Notes
    -----
    * The hook does **not** clone the batch before writing.  Whether
      data is copied depends on the sink implementation (e.g.
      :class:`HostMemory` moves to CPU; :class:`GPUBuffer` copies
      into pre-allocated slots).
    * For long simulations, prefer :class:`ZarrData` to avoid
      accumulating the full trajectory in memory.
    * When used inside a :class:`FusedStage`, the snapshot includes
      samples at all status codes in a single write.

class ConvergedSnapshotHook:
    """Write only newly converged samples to a :class:`DataSink`.

    Fires at :attr:`~DynamicsStage.ON_CONVERGE` and uses the converged
    sample indices (available via ``dynamics._last_converged``) to build
    a boolean mask passed to :meth:`DataSink.write`.  Only samples that
    just satisfied the convergence criterion are written — samples that
    converged on earlier steps are not re-written.

    This is the recommended hook for persisting optimized structures to
    Zarr in a :class:`FusedStage` pipeline, where multiple relaxations
    run concurrently and structures converge at different steps.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sink : DataSink
        The storage backend to write converged samples to.
        :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.sinks.ZarrData` is the typical
        choice for persistent storage.
    frequency : int, optional
        Execute every ``frequency`` steps. Default ``1`` (check every
        step that convergence fires).
