Demo dynamics implementations for testing and debugging.

This module provides ``DemoDynamics`` — a concrete, minimal implementation
of ``BaseDynamics`` for testing and debugging, analogous to how
``nvalchemi.models.demo`` provides ``DemoModelWrapper`` for models.

``DemoDynamics`` implements a standard Velocity Verlet integrator, which
is a symplectic, time-reversible algorithm commonly used in molecular
dynamics. This serves as a simple example of how to implement an integrator
by overriding the ``pre_update`` and ``post_update`` methods. Inter-rank
communication capabilities are inherited from ``BaseDynamics``.

class DemoDynamics(BaseDynamics):
    """
    Velocity Verlet integrator for molecular dynamics simulations.

    Implements the standard Velocity Verlet algorithm, a symplectic,
    time-reversible integration scheme commonly used in molecular dynamics.
    The algorithm splits the integration into two half-steps:

    1. ``pre_update``: Update positions using current velocities and accelerations
       x(t+dt) = x(t) + v(t)*dt + 0.5*a(t)*dt^2

    2. ``post_update``: Update velocities using averaged accelerations
       v(t+dt) = v(t) + 0.5*(a(t) + a(t+dt))*dt

    On the first step when previous accelerations are unavailable, falls back
    to Euler integration for velocities: v(t+dt) = v(t) + a(t+dt)*dt.

    Inter-rank communication capabilities for use in pipeline workflows are
    inherited from ``BaseDynamics``. Communication attributes include
    ``prior_rank``, ``next_rank``, ``sinks``, ``active_batch``,
    ``max_batch_size``, and ``done``.

    This class is intended **entirely** for testing and debugging, demonstrating
    how to implement an integrator by overriding ``pre_update`` and ``post_update``.
    Do **NOT** use this class for production.
