    Attributes
    ----------
    frequency : int
        How often the hook runs (every N steps).
    stage : Enum | None
        The stage enum value at which this hook runs, or ``None`` for
        hooks that are stage-agnostic until registered with a specific
        engine.
    on_register : Callable[[object], None], optional
        Optional lifecycle method called once by the registry after the
        hook passes stage/frequency validation and before it is stored.
        Hooks that mutate workflow topology or configuration should document
        their ordering assumptions because registration order is user-owned.

        Only called when the registry determines the hook should fire at
        the dispatched stage.  By default, hooks fire when
        ``stage == self.stage``.  To fire at multiple stages, define a
        ``_runs_on_stage(self, stage: Enum) -> bool`` method that returns
        ``True`` for each relevant stage.

        Frequency gating is handled by the registry: hooks are only
        called when ``step_count % frequency == 0``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ctx : HookContext
            Snapshot of the current workflow state. Workflow engines may pass
            a :class:`HookContext` subclass with additional fields.
        stage : Enum
            The stage being dispatched.

    ``model_dump()`` inside their ``state_dict`` implementation for
