"""AtomicData-native DataLoader with amortized prefetching.

The ``DataLoader`` class is designed to be a drop-in replacement
for ``torch.data.DataLoader``, specializing for ``nvalchemi``
and atomistic systems by emitting ``Batch`` data.

Additionally, the ``DataLoader`` can fuse several emitted batches into one
backend read. ``prefetch_factor`` controls that read window, while optional
CUDA streams can overlap device transfers when available. An optional
``batch_transforms`` hook applies user-supplied callables to each collated
:class:`Batch` on the consumer thread.

from __future__ import annotations

from collections.abc import Iterator, Sequence
from math import ceil

import torch
from torch.utils.data import RandomSampler, Sampler, SequentialSampler

class DataLoader:
    """Batch-iterating data loader that yields :class:`~nvalchemi.data.batch.Batch`.

    ``DataLoader`` is the consumer end of the pipeline
    (``Reader -> Dataset (-> MultiDataset) -> DataLoader``). It wraps a
    batch-loadable dataset -- a :class:`Dataset`, a
    :class:`~nvalchemi.data.datapipes.multidataset.MultiDataset`, or any object
    implementing :class:`BatchDatasetProtocol` -- and yields graph-collated
    :class:`~nvalchemi.data.batch.Batch` objects built via
    :meth:`~nvalchemi.data.batch.Batch.from_data_list`.

    Sampling follows PyTorch's conventions. With no sampler, ``shuffle`` selects
    a :class:`~torch.utils.data.RandomSampler` or
    :class:`~torch.utils.data.SequentialSampler`; a custom ``sampler`` (yielding
    sample indices) overrides ``shuffle``; and a ``batch_sampler`` (yielding
    whole lists of indices) sets the batch composition itself and is mutually
    exclusive with ``sampler``, ``shuffle``, and ``batch_size``. To mix several
    datasets, pair a
    :class:`~nvalchemi.data.datapipes.multidataset.MultiDataset` with
    :class:`~nvalchemi.data.datapipes.samplers.MultiDatasetSampler` (as
    ``sampler=``, per-sample rates) or
    :class:`~nvalchemi.data.datapipes.samplers.MultiDatasetBatchSampler` (as
    ``batch_sampler=``, a fixed per-batch mixture); under distributed training
    :class:`~nvalchemi.training.hooks.DDPHook` swaps in the rank-sharded
    variants automatically.

    Compared with :class:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, this loader yields
    ``Batch`` graphs rather than default-collated tensors, with graph-aware
    collation. Instead of forking worker processes it prefetches on background
    threads and overlaps device transfers on CUDA streams, and it *fuses* reads:
    ``prefetch_factor`` emitted batches are pulled from the backend in one
    windowed read (effective window ``batch_size * prefetch_factor``), which
    amortizes I/O far better than one ``__getitem__`` per sample. Set
    ``prefetch_factor=0`` to read a single emitted batch at a time, and
    ``pin_memory=True`` to request page-locked tensors from readers that support
    it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : BatchDatasetProtocol
        AtomicData-native dataset to load from.
    batch_size : int, default=1
        Number of samples per batch.
    shuffle : bool, default=False
        Randomize sample order each epoch.
    drop_last : bool, default=False
        Drop the last incomplete batch.
    sampler : torch.utils.data.Sampler | None, default=None
        Custom sampler (overrides ``shuffle``).
    batch_sampler : torch.utils.data.Sampler | None, default=None
        Custom sampler that yields batches of sample indices.
    prefetch_factor : int, default=2
        Number of emitted batches to fuse into each backend read. The effective
        read window is ``batch_size * prefetch_factor``. Set to 0 to disable
        fused prefetching and read one emitted batch at a time.
    num_streams : int, default=4
        Number of CUDA streams for prefetching.
    use_streams : bool, default=True
        Enable CUDA-stream prefetching.
    pin_memory : bool, default=False
        If True, request page-locked CPU tensors from readers that support
        pinned-memory reads.
    batch_transforms : Sequence[BatchTransform] | None, default=None
        Optional per-batch transforms applied to each yielded
        :class:`~nvalchemi.data.batch.Batch` after collation. ``None``
        or an empty sequence disables the hook (zero runtime overhead
        on the hot path). See the Notes section for thread placement
        and CUDA-stream semantics. For per-sample transforms applied
        before collation, see :class:`Dataset` (``transforms`` parameter).

    Attributes
    ----------
    dataset : BatchDatasetProtocol
        The underlying dataset.
    batch_size : int
        Number of samples per batch.
    sampler : torch.utils.data.Sampler
        Resolved sampler (``RandomSampler`` if ``shuffle=True``, else
        :class:`~torch.utils.data.SequentialSampler`; user-supplied
        ``sampler`` overrides both).
    drop_last : bool
        Whether the trailing partial batch is dropped.
    prefetch_factor : int
        Configured prefetch depth (see :meth:`__iter__`).
    num_streams : int
        Configured CUDA-stream pool size for prefetching.
    use_streams : bool
        Whether stream-based prefetching is actually enabled. Stored as
        ``use_streams and torch.cuda.is_available()``; reflects runtime
        availability, not the raw argument.
    pin_memory : bool
        Whether page-locked CPU tensors are requested from compatible readers.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised at construction if ``batch_size < 1`` or
        ``prefetch_factor < 0``.
    TypeError
        Raised at construction if ``batch_transforms`` is not a
        :class:`~collections.abc.Sequence` (e.g. a single callable or a
        generator was passed).
    RuntimeError
        Raised during iteration (not construction) when any batch
        transform fails; the original exception is chained via
        ``__cause__``.

    Notes
    -----
    Batch transforms run on the consumer (main) thread after
    collation, not on the prefetch workers; the fully assembled
    ``Batch`` does not exist until the main thread constructs it.
    Transforms are applied in order via
    :class:`~nvalchemi.data.transforms.Compose` and execute on the
    current CUDA stream at yield time; wrap iteration in your own
    ``torch.cuda.stream(...)`` context to control placement.
