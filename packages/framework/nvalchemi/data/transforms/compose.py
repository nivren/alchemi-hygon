"""Left-to-right composition helper for user-supplied data transforms.

A single :class:`Compose` class handles either per-sample transforms
(:data:`~nvalchemi._typing.SampleTransform`, taking and returning
``(AtomicData, metadata)``) or per-batch transforms
(:data:`~nvalchemi._typing.BatchTransform`, taking and returning
:class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch`). The composition kind is fixed at
construction by inspecting each callable's type annotations; mixing
sample and batch transforms in the same :class:`Compose` is rejected.

Transforms must *return* their (possibly mutated) output; in-place
mutation without returning is not supported.

class Compose:
    """Compose a sequence of transforms into a single callable.

    Transforms are applied left-to-right: the output of transform
    ``i`` becomes the input to transform ``i + 1``. An empty sequence
    acts as the identity.

    A :class:`Compose` is either a *sample* composition or a *batch*
    composition, inferred at construction from the type annotations of
    the supplied callables. Each typed callable must declare its first
    positional parameter as :class:`~nvalchemi.data.AtomicData` (sample
    transform) or :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` (batch transform);
    untyped callables are accepted and take on the kind established by
    the typed ones. Mixing sample and batch transforms in the same
    :class:`Compose` raises :class:`TypeError`. A composition with no
    typed callables defaults to sample semantics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transforms : Sequence[SampleTransform | BatchTransform]
        Transforms to compose in application order. Any iterable is
        accepted and eagerly materialized into an immutable
        :class:`tuple`. Each entry must be callable.

    Attributes
    ----------
    transforms : tuple[SampleTransform, ...] | tuple[BatchTransform, ...]
        The composed transforms, stored in application order.
    is_batch : bool
        ``True`` if this is a batch composition, ``False`` if it is a
        sample composition. ``False`` for an empty / all-untyped
        composition (defaults to sample semantics).

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If any entry is not callable, if a typed first parameter is
        neither :class:`AtomicData` nor :class:`Batch`, or if typed
        callables disagree on the composition kind.
    RuntimeError
        (At call time) If any transform raises; the original exception
        is wrapped in a :class:`RuntimeError` identifying the failing
        index, with the original exception attached via ``__cause__``.

    Examples
    --------
    Per-sample composition:

    ...     new_data = data.model_copy(update={"positions": data.positions + 1.0})

    ...     return data, metadata
    >>> compose = Compose([shift_positions, tag_origin])  # doctest: +SKIP
