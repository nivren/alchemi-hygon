"""Base protocols and models for loss-function schedules.

This module also re-exports :class:`BaseLossFunction` and
:class:`ComposedLossFunction` from :mod:`.composition` for discoverability:
subclass authors can do ``from nvalchemi.training.losses.base import
BaseLossFunction`` without tracking the internal module layout. The
canonical home of the leaf base class, keyed composition aggregator, and
composition output type remains :mod:`.composition`.

    """Runtime-checkable protocol for loss-weight schedules.

    Any object callable with signature ``(step: int, epoch: int) -> float``,
    exposing a ``per_epoch`` attribute, and returning a rebuild recipe from
    ``to_spec()`` satisfies this protocol. Such objects are accepted inside
    :class:`~nvalchemi.training.losses.ComposedLossFunction`'s ``weights``
    sequence or as the right-hand side of ``schedule * leaf``. Concrete
    Pydantic schedules live in
    :mod:`~nvalchemi.training.losses.schedules`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    per_epoch
        If ``True``, the schedule should advance by ``epoch`` instead of
        by ``step``. This aligns loss-weight updates with training loops
        that update learning-rate schedules once per epoch.

    Parameters
    ----------
    step
        Current global training step (0-indexed).
    epoch
        Current epoch number (0-indexed).

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Scalar weight to apply to the associated loss term.
