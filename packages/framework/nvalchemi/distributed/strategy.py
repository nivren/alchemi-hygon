"""Parallelization strategy: the single owner of strategy-dependent behavior.

A :class:`ParallelizationStrategy` owns the whole vertical slice of behavior
that varies along the parallelization axis — how the batch is scattered, how the
cell/PBC is tracked, how atoms migrate, how per-system quantities reduce, and how
the forward is prepared and consolidated. Models, integrators, and drivers stay
strategy-agnostic and express *intent*; the strategy provides *mechanism*.

Two strategies ship here, one per existing layout:

* :class:`HaloStrategy` — spatial domain decomposition (owned + ghost halo). The
  cell is load-bearing (fractional coords + ghost widths), the partition evolves
  as atoms cross domains, and per-system reductions sum owned shards.
* :class:`GraphPartitionStrategy` — node-partition graph parallel. Atoms split by
  index; features all-gathered per layer, gradients reduce-scattered. The cell is
  an ordinary model input; no migration.

Each strategy wraps the per-field :class:`StoragePolicy` that carries its
tensor-level transport (scatter/gather/refresh/fold); the strategy adds the
orchestration verbs that a driver sequences. The protocol methods are derived
from the responsibility table in ``proposal-distributed-strategy-refactor.md``
§2 — every method corresponds to a column that genuinely differs across the
strategies, with no speculative hooks.
