"""Bridge for running a halo-distributed model under ``torch.compile``.

Under ``torch.compile`` a ShardTensor is traced away, so a domain-decomposed
model must run the compiled region on plain tensors with the halo routing
surfaced as graph inputs (not Python constants), and re-create the per-layer
ghost refresh that eager dispatch does for free. :class:`HaloCompileBridge`
provides that scaffolding once so each model wrapper does not hand-roll it:

* **plain-ify + route.** The caller hands a ``dict`` of inputs (some entries
  ShardTensors); the bridge ``to_local``\\ s them and threads the four halo
  routing tensors ``(send_index, recv_dest, recv_real, n_owned)`` as graph
  inputs, anchored live on an entry tensor via
  :func:`~nvalchemi.distributed.compile_refresh.keep_routing_live` (otherwise
  Dynamo prunes unused inputs). The dict preserves input names so the
  compile-refresh pass can match ``edge_index``.
* **pluggable refresh.** ``refresh="pass"`` uses the compile-refresh graph
  pass, which auto-inserts the halo correction at each ``edge_index``-keyed
  scatter — the zero-config path for a clean message-passing model.
  ``refresh="self"`` uses a plain backend for models that carry their own
  refresh inside the traced region (MACE, AIMNet2), which the pass can't reach
  (e.g. MACE's e3nn graph breaks); the bridge then only provides the plain-ify
  + routing scaffolding.

The compiled callable is cached on first call and reused across MD steps;
fixed-shape input caps keep the graph stable so there are no steady-state
recompiles.

    Parameters
    ----------
    forward
        ``forward(inputs: dict) -> output`` — the compilable region. The caller
        adapts its model's signature here (e.g. ``lambda mi: model(mi["positions"],
        mi["edge_index"])``), keeping the bridge signature-agnostic.
    world_size
        Static mesh size — baked into the inserted halo op by the pass.
    refresh
        ``"pass"`` (auto-insert the halo correction; clean models) or
        ``"self"`` (model carries its own refresh; plain backend).
    inner_backend
        Backend the pass defers to / the plain backend (default ``inductor``;
        ``aot_eager`` for codegen-free dev).
    anchor_key
        Input the routing tensors are anchored live on (default
        ``"positions"``); must be a tensor present in every ``inputs`` dict.
    routing_keys
        Names the four routing tensors are threaded under (must match the pass).
