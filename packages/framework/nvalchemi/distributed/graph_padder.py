"""Fixed-shape graph padding for compiled domain-decomposed MD.

Under ``torch.compile``, a domain-decomposed model's graph must keep a stable
shape across MD steps, or every step that changes the owned+ghost atom / edge
count triggers a recompile. The fix is to pad each step's graph to fixed
per-rank capacities with inert dead atoms / dead edges that contribute nothing.

This module owns two pieces of that mechanism:

* :class:`GraphPadder` — the protocol a model declares (via
  ``CompilePolicy(graph_padder=...)``) for *how* its graph representation is
  padded to a capacity and stripped back. The framework owns *when* to pad; the
  padder owns the representation-specific ``pad`` / ``unpad``. Built-ins cover
  common representations (COO ``edge_index``, dense ``(N, K)`` neighbor matrix)
  so most models declare nothing.
* :func:`resolve_cap` — the shared grow-only capacity policy.

        Mutable dict holding the persistent caps across forwards (the caller

    key
        Which capacity (e.g. ``"atoms"`` / ``"edges"`` / ``"max_send"``).
    real
        The real count needed this step (before padding).
    initial_factor
        Headroom multiplier applied the first time ``key`` is sized, set to cover
        the equilibrated peak from the first compile (e.g. edges climb ~25%
        through equilibration, atoms barely move).
    grow_factor
        Headroom multiplier applied on a later overflow.
    stride
        Bucket size; the cap is rounded up to a multiple of this (16 for
        kernel-friendly shapes; coarser counts that swing more use a larger one).
    extra
        Slots reserved beyond ``real`` (e.g. UMA reserves 2 for the dead-edge
        anchor pair).
    strict_gt
        Overflow test: ``real + extra > cap`` when True (the default; edges /
        send), or ``>= cap`` when False (atoms, which need a strictly-larger cap
        because the dead row sits at ``cap - 1``).

    :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch`\\ es (AIMNet2).

    The batch-level counterpart of :class:`DensePadder`. The framework compiles
    the whole ``wrapper.forward``, so the fixed-shape padding must land on the
    halo-padded ``Batch`` *before* ``adapt_input`` runs — the same seam
    :class:`COOPadder` uses. This padder pads the atom-level storage group to a
    fixed atom capacity with inert dead atoms (zeros, ``Z=0``, joined to the last
    graph) and repoints the ``neighbor_matrix`` sentinel so no real atom ever sees
    a dead atom as a neighbor.

    ``adapt_input`` then appends its own padding atom on top of this fixed-shape
    batch, so the compiled model input keeps a constant ``(n_cap + 1, …)`` shape
    across MD steps. The sentinel is repointed to ``n_cap`` — the index of that
    appended pad atom — so aimnet's ``calc_masks`` masks every dead / sentinel
    neighbor slot to zero.

    :meth:`unpad` is a no-op: the owned-only ``mol_sum`` (masked by ``n_owned``)
    drops the dead rows from the energy, and the per-atom force output is sliced
    by the framework's output consolidation. The framework restores the transient
    padded storage separately (the padded ``Batch`` is reused in place across MD
    steps).

        index.
    initial_factor, grow_factor, stride
