"""Adapter that turns a single-process model wrapper into a distributed callable.

Pattern::

    wrapper    = MACEWrapper.from_checkpoint("small")
    sharded    = ShardedBatch.from_batch(full_batch, mesh=m, config=cfg)
    dist_model = DistributedModel(wrapper, cfg)
    out        = dist_model(sharded)        # dict[str, Tensor]
    e          = out["energy"]              # globally reduced
    f          = out["forces"]              # per-rank owned rows

The adapter owns framework concerns (halo padding, output consolidation) so
inner wrappers stay single-process-focused. Per-model distributed knowledge
lives in the wrapper's ``distribution_spec``.

Composite wrappers (``PipelineModelWrapper``) are rejected here — use
``DistributedPipelineModel`` for distributed composition.

    Safe (and correct) to call whenever a model runs under a multi-rank DD scope —
    compiled by the framework OR pre-compiled by its own loader (e.g. MACE
    ``loader.compile``), since the hazards below are triggered by the *wrapped*
    model recompiling under DD, independent of who invoked ``torch.compile``.

    1. **Recompile ceiling.** The fixed-shape caps grow during warmup
       (``max_send`` / ``n_cap`` / ``e_cap`` each bump shapes a few times before
       settling), so more than the default 8 recompiles are expected. If a rank
       hits the limit and stops recompiling mid-warmup it diverges from its peer
       and the halo all-to-all deadlocks (NCCL watchdog timeout). torch>=2.6
       renamed ``cache_size_limit`` -> ``recompile_limit`` (plus the accumulated
       twin); set whichever names exist so the ceiling actually takes effect.
    2. **Per-rank on-disk compile caches.** The inductor FxGraphCache + the
       (separate) AOTAutograd cache key on the *local* rank's graph but default to
       ONE shared dir, so under multi-rank DD a rank can deserialize another rank's
       guarded entry and hit a ``KeyError`` (e.g. a cueq segment ``lengths`` dim) →
       skip a collective → NCCL deadlock. The fix is to point each rank at its OWN
       cache dir (keeping the caches ON — disabling them re-lowers the AOT graph
       every step). This calls :func:`isolate_compile_cache_per_rank`, a no-op if the
       dirs are already set. Since those dirs are read at first-forward lowering (not
       when ``torch.compile`` wraps the model) and this runs at ``DistributedModel``
       construction, it lands before the first DD forward — including the common
       ``from_checkpoint(compile_model=True)`` -> ``DistributedModel`` order, where
       the loader only wraps (lazily) and runs no forward. A launcher exporting the
