"""Distribution spec — each model's declaration of what the distributed
framework must provide for it.

Two layers:

* :class:`DistributionSpec` (in ``_core/spec.py``) carries the
  framework-generic fields: a :class:`StoragePolicy`
  (:class:`HaloStoragePolicy`, or ``None`` for the local case) plus the
  ``custom_ops`` and ``third_party_helpers`` tuples.
* :class:`MLIPSpec` (this module) wraps it and adds output-classification
  sets (``owned_only_outputs``, ``all_reduce_outputs``).

:class:`MLIPSpec` is the public spec. The recommended form declares each
output once via ``outputs={name: OutputSpec(kind, reduce)}``; the parallel
``owned_only_outputs`` / ``all_reduce_outputs`` / ``output_kinds`` sets remain
for serialization. Models declare their spec via
``BaseModelMixin.distribution_spec``; the ``SPEC_*_HALO`` presets cover the
model families we target. See :meth:`MLIPSpec.to_dict` /
:meth:`MLIPSpec.from_dict` for the JSON wire format.
