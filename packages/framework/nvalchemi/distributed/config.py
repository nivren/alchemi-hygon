"""Configuration types for spatial domain decomposition.

:class:`DomainConfig` is a flat Pydantic model bundling the three concerns a
distributed scope needs: process-mesh topology, halo/skin geometry, and the
spatial-partition grid.

class StrategyKind(str, Enum):
    """Which parallelization strategy a distributed scope runs under.

    Selected on :class:`DomainConfig` (config-driven, not an env var). The model's
    ``distribution_spec(strategy)`` returns the ``(policy, adapters, shard_fields,
    consolidation)`` bundle for the chosen strategy; the framework builds the live
    :class:`~nvalchemi.distributed.strategy.ParallelizationStrategy` from the
    resulting storage policy.

    Attributes
    ----------
    HALO : str
        Spatial domain decomposition (owned atoms + ghost halo). Default.
    GRAPH_PARTITION : str
        Node-partition graph parallel (owned node slice per rank).

    Attributes
    ----------
    LOCAL : str
        Hook runs on every rank with its local subdomain batch.
    GLOBAL : str
        Hook runs on every rank after an all-gather produces the full batch.
    RANK_ZERO : str
        Hook runs only on rank 0 after gathering.

class DomainConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for one spatial domain-decomposition scope.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cutoff : float
        Interaction cutoff radius used by the model.
    skin : float
        Additional skin distance for neighbor-list buffering. Default 0.
    ghost_width : float | None
        Width of the ghost (halo) region. When ``None``, the effective
        width defaults to ``cutoff + skin`` via :meth:`effective_ghost_width`.
        An explicit value must be at least ``cutoff + skin``.
    strategy : StrategyKind
        Parallelization strategy for this scope: ``StrategyKind.HALO`` (spatial
        domain decomposition with a ghost halo, the default) or
        ``StrategyKind.GRAPH_PARTITION`` (node-partition graph parallel).
    compile : bool
        Compile intent for the distributed forward. When ``True`` the framework
        owns the compiled forward and pads per-rank atom/edge counts to stable
        shapes so the compiled graph is reused across steps; when ``False`` the
        padder is disabled. Default ``False``.
    require_nondegenerate : bool
        When ``True``, a degenerate partition — one where some rank's halo
        already covers every atom (0 remote atoms) — is a hard error instead of
        a warning. Default ``False``.
    mesh : DeviceMesh | None
        Optional ``torch.distributed.device_mesh.DeviceMesh`` describing the
        rank topology. ``None`` for single-rank runs.
    mesh_dim : str
        Name of the mesh dimension used for domain parallelism. Default
        ``"domain"``.
    grid_dims : tuple[int, int, int] | None
        Explicit grid dimensions for the spatial decomposition. When ``None``,
        the partitioner chooses cells-per-dim from the cell matrix and cutoff.
    scripted_marshal : {"auto", "declared", "off"}
        Controls marshalling of ``@torch.jit.script`` ops across the ShardTensor
        boundary (a scripted kernel reading a ShardTensor's storage-less
        ``data_ptr`` triggers a CUDA illegal memory access). ``"auto"`` (default):
        auto-discover scripted submodules and wrap them, plus install the spec's
        declared ``JitAdapter`` marshallers. ``"declared"``: install only the
        spec's declared adapters, no auto-discovery. ``"off"``: no marshalling at
        all. Overridable via ``NVALCHEMI_SCRIPTED_MARSHAL``.
    scripted_marshal_exclude : tuple[str, ...]
        Submodule-name substrings to skip during ``"auto"`` discovery — for a
        scripted op that genuinely needs cross-rank data (where marshalling to
        local would silently give wrong numbers) or is handled via ``custom_ops``.
    migration_hysteresis : float | None
        Migration-hysteresis margin in angstrom: an atom keeps its current owner
        until it is this far past a domain boundary, preventing per-step
        migration thrashing of boundary atoms. When ``None`` (default), the
        effective value is ``skin / 2`` (see :meth:`effective_migration_hysteresis`);
        it must be ``< skin`` so a deferred atom stays within the owner's halo.
