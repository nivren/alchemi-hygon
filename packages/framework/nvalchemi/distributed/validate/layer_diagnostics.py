"""Module-level layer-by-layer divergence diagnostic.

When ``trace_and_validate`` rejects a spec on per-output diff alone,
the helper-trace classifier can flag a few suspect ``aimnet.nbops``
calls but rarely points at the actual root cause when the bug is two
or three layers upstream. This module installs forward hooks on every
named sub-module of ``wrapper.model`` to record per-module owned-row
output sums on both the single-process reference and each spawned
rank, then in the launcher compares ref vs ``sum(ranks)`` per module
and surfaces the first divergent module name.

Per-rank tensors carry one trailing rank-local padding row by
convention (e.g. AIMNet2's nb_mode=1 layout); single-process carries
exactly one. To compare apples-to-apples we drop the trailing row
before summing on both sides — the partition arithmetic
``sum(rank) == ref`` then holds when the spec is correct.
