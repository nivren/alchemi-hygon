"""Single-call distributed-spec inference + validation.

`trace_and_validate(model_factory, sample_batch, ...)` does:

1. Reference run — single-process forward on the sample batch, captured
   under :func:`~nvalchemi.distributed._core.dispatch_trace.dispatch_trace` so
   we observe which custom ops fire and what shapes they produce. This
   is also the ground-truth output the multi-rank run is compared
   against.
2. Spec inference — translate the trace's observed firings into a
   candidate :class:`MLIPSpec`. The wrapper's existing
   ``distribution_spec`` (if defined) is treated as a strong prior:
   missing fields are inferred; provided fields are kept verbatim.
3. Validation — spawn ``world_size`` processes on the same GPU device,
   each running the wrapper through :class:`DistributedModel` with the
   inferred spec. Compare per-output tensors against the reference and
   produce a per-output diff.
4. Auto-fix — if the validation diff exceeds tolerance, run a small
   rule engine that proposes spec mutations from a corpus of patterns
   we've encountered (UMA halo-correction double-count,
   under/over-reduction). Each rule is tried in turn; the first that
   clears tolerance wins. The returned ``spec`` is the working one.

The returned :class:`TraceReport` is *actionable*: it gives a single
``next_action`` string and a serializable spec, so the user can either
paste the spec into their wrapper or save it to disk for cache reuse.

Module layout
-------------

``trace_and_validate`` (the public entry) lives here. The internals
are split across siblings:

* :mod:`.types` — :class:`Attempt`, :class:`TraceReport` dataclasses.
* :mod:`.payloads` — Batch ↔ tensor-dict wire format + diff metric.
* :mod:`.reference` — single-process reference run + NL summary.
* :mod:`.halo_diagnostics` — halo-completeness check.
* :mod:`.worker` — per-rank ``mp.spawn`` target.
* :mod:`.inference` — spawn orchestration + spec inference.
* :mod:`.autofix` — rule engine + spec signatures.

Each sibling is independently testable; ``trace_and_validate`` is the
glue that wires them in the documented order.

    run, and (optionally) auto-fix when validation fails.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_factory
        Callable returning a freshly-constructed wrapper. Called once
        in the launcher process for the reference run, and once per
        rank in each spawned worker. Pristine state every time —
        no shared module graph between processes.
    sample_batch
        A :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` (or compatible) carrying
        positions / cell / pbc on the target ``device``. Small enough
        that ``world_size`` copies fit in memory at once.
    world_size
        Virtual ranks to spawn on the same GPU. The default (2) is
        sufficient to flush the dispatch logic; larger values catch
        partition-dependent bugs but cost spawn overhead linearly.
    device
        CUDA device all ranks bind to. Default ``"cuda:0"``. CPU
        validation is *not* supported by this entry point — CPU/GPU
        numerical drift makes it unreliable; if you need it, call
        the harness in ``test_dispatch_trace_gloo.py`` directly.
    atol
        Per-output absolute tolerance. Pass criterion (per output) is
        ``abs_diff <= atol OR rel_diff <= rtol`` — same convention
        :func:`torch.testing.assert_close` uses, so extensive
        quantities (energy scales linearly with atom count) compare
        correctly across system sizes.
    rtol
        Per-output relative tolerance. Default ``1e-4`` covers fp32
        round-off accumulation across collective reductions on the
        ``cpu:gloo,cuda:gloo`` backend; tighten to e.g. ``1e-5`` when
        running NCCL or fp64.
    auto_fix
        When the initial inferred spec fails validation, try
        rule-based mutations. Disable to get a single-attempt report.
    max_fix_attempts
        Cap on the number of distinct specs auto-fix will try.
    backend
        ``"nccl"``, ``"gloo"``, or ``"auto"`` (NCCL when CUDA is
        available, else Gloo). Both correctly route over CUDA tensors;
        NCCL is faster.
    timeout_sec
        Per-spawn join timeout.
    watched_helper_packages
        Fully-qualified module paths whose top-level Python helpers
        get instrumented during the reference and per-rank runs. The
        :mod:`~nvalchemi.distributed._core.helper_trace` proxy records each
        call's input / output shapes + sums; the
        :mod:`~nvalchemi.distributed._core.helper_diagnosis` classifier then
        flags helpers that look like distribution gaps (per-system
        reductions whose per-rank outputs sum to the reference output
        but aren't declared in ``spec.distribution.third_party_helpers``).
        Defaults to ``("aimnet.nbops",)``. Pass an explicit empty
        tuple to disable. Unimportable packages are skipped silently.
    helper_sample_every
        Record every Nth call after the first call per
        ``(module, function)``. Default 8 keeps overhead bounded for
        hot helpers (``mol_sum`` runs multiple times per layer); set
        to 1 for exhaustive recording (debug only).

    Returns
    -------
    TraceReport
