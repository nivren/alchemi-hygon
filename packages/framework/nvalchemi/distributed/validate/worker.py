"""Per-rank entry point for the validator's ``mp.spawn`` workers.

Each worker:
1. Initialises the process group (NCCL or Gloo backend).
2. Patches physicsnemo's ``all_to_all_v`` for Gloo when applicable.
3. Constructs the wrapper, evaluates ``distribution_spec`` (so lazy
   imports + custom-op registration fire), reconstructs the spec from
   the dict shipped from the parent.
4. Runs forward inside ``DistributedModel`` and captures dispatch
   trace + helper trace + halo-completeness summary.
5. Ships the results back to the parent over a queue, surviving
   crashes by sending whatever helper records were collected before
   the failure.
