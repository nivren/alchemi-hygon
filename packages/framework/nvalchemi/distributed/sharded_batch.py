"""ShardedBatch: user-facing distributed counterpart to ``Batch``.

Per-atom fields (positions, velocities, forces, atomic_numbers, atomic_masses)
are stored as ``ShardTensor`` with ``Shard(0)`` placement (uneven across ranks);
per-system fields (cell, pbc) are replicated.

``ShardedBatch`` is what the user hands to ``DistributedModel``; the adapter
pulls ``.local_batch`` out per call to drive the halo-padded forward.
