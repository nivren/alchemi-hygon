"""Context-aware helpers for domain-decomposed model wrappers.

Functions a model author calls inside a wrapper to express a distributed
operation by intent — "refresh my neighbor rows", "sum per system" — without
naming the mechanism. Each reads the live distributed context the framework
sets up for the forward and does the right thing under the halo policy, in
single-process, and under ``torch.compile``.

This is the shared home of logic that would otherwise be copy-pasted across
model wrappers.

    class. Each adapter runs the block, then applies :func:`scatter_to_owners` to
    forward output ``output`` (an ``int`` index when the block returns a tuple,
