"""Argument and output transforms for opaque-kernel adapters.

Declarative, zero-data marker dataclasses keyed by argument / output
position on an :class:`~nvalchemi.distributed._core.adapter.OpAdapter`.
They describe how a sharded/halo tensor must be reshaped around an
*opaque* kernel — one that bypasses ShardTensor's ``__torch_function__``
(Warp / Triton ``custom_op`` / ``@torch.jit.script``) and would
otherwise see only the per-rank local view.

* Argument transforms reshape an input *before* the kernel fires
  (:class:`GatherInputs`, :class:`GatherInputsFull`, :class:`SliceOwned`).
* Output transforms reshape a result *after* the kernel returns
  (:class:`ScatterOutputs`, :class:`AllReduceSum`, :class:`SliceOutputsOwned`).

Each is a frozen marker so future configuration (reduce op, slice
ranges) can land additively. The :class:`~...adapter.AdapterRegistry`
applies them around the wrapped op via the relevant collective.

Part of the upstream-candidate ``_core/`` surface; intentionally
domain-free.

    The fused-scatter pattern (e.g. MACE-cueq): kernel writes per-row
    values into halo rows; halo_reverse routes those partial contributions
    to the owners; halo_forward refreshes halo copies to match.

class AllReduceSum:
    """Sum the output's per-rank partial across the mesh via
    :func:`distributed_all_reduce`.

    Pair with :class:`SliceOwned` on the input side — slice ensures each
    atom contributes once locally; AllReduceSum collects partials into a
    globally-correct result.

    Parameters
    ----------
    replicated_consumer : bool, default False
        Whether the gradient arriving at this node in backward is already the
        global sum. ``False`` (the default) means it is this rank's partial and
        the adjoint sums across ranks — the all-reduce is its own adjoint.
        ``True`` means every rank already holds the same gradient, so reducing
        again would multiply it by the world size.

        This is a property of how the reduced value is consumed downstream, and
        it is measurable: capture ``grad_out`` in
        ``_DistributedAllReduceSum.backward`` and compare it across ranks. On
        PME's eager path the charge mesh's incoming gradient is bit-identical on
        every rank (hence ``True`` there), while the total charge's differs
        (hence the default). Do not infer it — measure it.
