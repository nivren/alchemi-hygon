"""ShardedCollection: a set of named tensors distributed over a device mesh,
where **each field declares how it is distributed** via a
:class:`~nvalchemi.distributed._core.storage_policy.StoragePolicy`.

This is the domain-agnostic, multi-field counterpart to a single ShardTensor.
Distribution is *declared* (a field->policy map), not *inferred* from what a
field means — so the scatter/gather bookkeeping lives here once, and
domain-specific containers (e.g. an atomic-data batch) subclass it and supply
only their field->policy map + any extra padding logic.

The container carries no chemistry: it knows ``mesh``, ``fields``, and
``policies`` and nothing about atoms, energies, or forces.
