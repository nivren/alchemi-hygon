"""In-compile halo-routing holder.

The per-layer neighbor refresh runs inside the compiled region and needs the
halo routing tensors, which vary every step — so they must reach it as graph
inputs, never as constants baked at trace time. The compile bridge publishes the
routing here from its graph inputs; the in-region refresh helper reads it back.
Both happen in the same compiled frame, so Dynamo threads the tensors through.
Outside compile the holder is ``None`` and the helpers take their eager path.
