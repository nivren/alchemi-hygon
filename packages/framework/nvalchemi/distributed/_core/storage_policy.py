"""Storage policies: how a field's *local storage* relates to its *placement*.

A :class:`StoragePolicy` is the per-field declaration that a distributed
collection consumes to scatter, view, and gather one field. The placement
stays honest (``Shard(0)`` / ``Replicate()``); the policy says how this rank's
local storage relates to it and how to move the data on/off the mesh.

Two policies ship here:

* :class:`PlainShard` — ``Shard(0)``: each rank stores only its owned rows as a
  ``ShardTensor``.
* :class:`HaloStoragePolicy` — ``Shard(0)`` + a borrowed-row overlay that
  intercepts ``scatter_add`` for per-layer halo correction. Note the overlay is
  built downstream (per message-passing layer), not at collection-construction
  time — so for *collection* construction this behaves like a plain shard.

The policies are domain-agnostic (rows, ranks, shards — no chemistry). They
own both halves of the protocol: the construction/transport methods
(``place_from_*`` / ``to_local`` / ``full_tensor``) and the op-dispatch methods
(``scatter`` / ``gather`` by global index, with halo correction) that the
ShardTensor dispatch handlers route through.

    This is the honest semantic layer for halo-padded fields. Its
    ``placement`` of ``Shard(0)`` is the conceptual truth — the owned rows are a
    row-shard of the global tensor; the halo rows are a *declared overlay*, not
    part of the global tensor. The local storage (``stored._local_tensor``) is
    the padded ``[n_owned + n_halo, *F]`` view the model operates on; the
    overlay-aware operations live here.

    Note: the underlying ``ShardTensorSpec``'s placement is left as a documented
    placeholder (an honest ``Shard(0)`` spec would need every rank's padded row
    count — an all-gather on every construction). This policy, not the base
    spec, carries the honest semantics; cross-rank routing flows through the
    registered dispatch handlers via :meth:`scatter` / :meth:`gather`.

    The ``scatter_mode`` / ``gather_mode`` capture the cross-rank behavior a
    field needs (e.g. UMA's wrapper sets ``scatter_mode="local"`` to skip halo
    correction). The dispatch classifier reads them to decide whether the halo
    branch fires. The topology (``n_owned`` / routing) and process group live on
    the ShardTensor (``_meta`` / ``_config``); the policy reads them per call.
