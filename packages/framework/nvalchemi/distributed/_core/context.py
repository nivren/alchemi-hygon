"""Per-scope distributed runtime metadata.

:class:`DistributedContext` is the single object carrying the
runtime-only metadata that a model wrapper needs to read on every
forward pass under a :class:`~nvalchemi.distributed.DistributedModel`
scope.

Lifecycle::

    DistributedModel.__enter__
        ctx = DistributedContext(...)               # built once
        wrapper.distributed_setup(ctx)              # wrapper stashes ref
    DistributedModel.__call__(sharded_batch)
        ctx.halo_meta   = sharded.halo_meta         # per-step write
        ctx.gather_meta = ...                       # per-step write
        wrapper(padded)                              # wrapper reads ctx
    DistributedModel.__exit__
        wrapper.distributed_teardown()              # wrapper drops ref

The ctx is *mutable* by design: per-step values like
:attr:`halo_meta` / :attr:`gather_meta` are updated by the framework
on every forward pass, with the wrapper holding a single reference
that always observes the current state.

Part of the upstream-candidate ``_core/`` surface; must not import
from ``nvalchemi.models`` / ``nvalchemi.data`` / ``nvalchemi.dynamics`` /
``nvalchemi.distributed._chemistry``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    mesh
        The :class:`torch.distributed.device_mesh.DeviceMesh` that the
        scope's collective ops dispatch over. ``None`` for single-rank
        runs.
    halo_config
        :class:`~nvalchemi.distributed._core.particle_halo.ParticleHaloConfig`
        carrying the partitioner + ghost-width + process group needed
        for halo exchanges. Set once in
        :meth:`DistributedModel._ensure_initialized`; stays constant
        across calls.
    n_systems_global
        Number of graphs in the global batch (i.e. before sharding).
        Used by wrappers that need to size per-system tensors against
        the un-partitioned count rather than the per-rank slice.
    n_atoms_total
        Number of atoms in the global batch. Used by Ewald / PME for
        cache sizing of reciprocal-space resources keyed on the global
        atom count.
    halo_meta
        Per-step :class:`~nvalchemi.distributed._core.particle_halo.ParticleHaloMetadata`
        produced by the latest halo exchange. ``None`` outside of the
        halo-storage call path or before the first forward pass.
    gather_meta
        Per-step :class:`~nvalchemi.distributed._core.gather_primitives.ShardRouting`
        produced by the latest sharded-storage call. ``None`` outside of
        the sharded-storage path or before the first forward pass.
