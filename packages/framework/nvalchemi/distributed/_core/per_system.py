"""Distributed segmented (per-group) reduction primitive.

Reduces a sharded per-row tensor into per-group values, where each row
carries an integer group index and the group's rows may be split across
mesh ranks. Needed by any model that does a global per-group reduction
inside the forward pass (rather than only at the output). In MLIP usage a
"group" is a molecular system and a "row" is an atom; concrete cases:

  - AIMNet2: ``mol_sum`` every message-passing pass (charge conservation)
  - UMA OMOL: ``balance_channels_batched`` every layer
  - MEGNet / M3GNet: ``readout_nodes`` mean-pool injected back into per-atom
  - Ewald: structure factor reduction per system per k-point

Signature::

    per_system_reduce(local_vals, system_index, n_systems, config, op=SUM)

Forward: local scatter_sum per group + ``all_reduce`` across the domain
mesh. Backward: all_reduce the incoming gradient (adjoint of a sum-based
all_reduce is itself), then ``index_select`` back to per-row grads.

Only ``ReduceOp.SUM`` is implemented; the MEAN / MAX / MIN extensions are
sketched at the bottom of this file.
