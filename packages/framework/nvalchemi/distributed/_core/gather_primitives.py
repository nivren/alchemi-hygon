"""Gather-mode primitives: on-demand cross-rank ``index_select`` and
``scatter_add`` routed by GLOBAL atom IDs.

A sharded tensor stores only its rank's ``n_owned`` rows. Global-index
ops (``index_select``, ``scatter_add_``) route requests to the owning
rank via ``all_to_all_v`` exchanges. Elementwise ops (``a + b``,
``mlp(a)``) stay local — there are no halo rows to keep in sync.

These primitives are used by :class:`nvalchemi.distributed._core.shard_tensor.ShardTensor`
when its spec declares ``gather="distributed"`` or ``scatter="distributed"``.
