# nvalchemi Fine Tuning

## Overview

Use `FineTuningStrategy` when adapting pretrained weights to a new dataset,
objective, trainable parameter set, or model head. Link users to
`docs/userguide/finetuning.md`, `docs/userguide/training.md`,
`docs/userguide/models.md`, and `docs/userguide/losses.md` for full details.

```python
import torch

from nvalchemi.training import (
    CheckpointHook,
    EnergyMSELoss,
    FineTuningStrategy,
    ForceMSELoss,
    OptimizerConfig,
    ValidationConfig,
    create_model_spec,
    default_training_fn,
)
```

## CLI Usage

Use `nvalchemi-training finetune` when the user wants quick experimentation:
an offline JSON spec, a scaffold for a supported source model, a Rich intent
report, or direct CLI execution without needing full API knowledge. Use a
Python script with `FineTuningStrategy` when the user needs arbitrary code,
custom model construction, dynamic data routing, dynamic losses, or non-standard
orchestration. Use `nvalchemi-training train init` for training-from-scratch
specs. The main groups are `train`, `finetune`, `schema` (`dump`, `template`),
and `spec` (`report`, `run`). Fine-tuning sources live under `finetune init`:
`checkpoint`, `mace`, `aimnet2`, and `custom`.

Common flow:

```bash
nvalchemi-training finetune init mace small-0b \
  --dataset data/train.zarr \
  --output-dir runs/mace-ft \
  --loss-dtype-policy prediction_to_target \
  --out mace-ft.json
nvalchemi-training spec report mace-ft.json
nvalchemi-training spec run mace-ft.json
```

Use `--loss-dtype-policy` on `finetune init` or `train init` when the CLI
scaffold should serialize dtype alignment in `strategy.loss_fn_spec`. `spec
report` renders the selected policy before execution.

Repeat `--dataset` to record a MultiDataset workflow. Use `torchrun ... -m
nvalchemi.training.cli spec run SPEC --distributed` for DDP; the CLI initializes
`DistributedManager`, prepends `DDPHook`, builds the dataset(s), constructs the
strategy, and calls `run(...)`.

Runtime hooks belong in `source.hooks`. Each entry contains a `spec` object
that is the serialized `BaseSpec` itself: `cls_path`, `timestamp`, and the
constructor keyword fields for the hook. The CLI builds the hook during spec
validation and rejects entries that are not `Hook` or `CheckpointableHook`
instances. The optional `stages` list uses `TrainingStage` names to override
where the hook fires, and `spec report` lists hook firing order chronologically.
For model-input transforms such as neighbor lists, use `BEFORE_FORWARD`; this
stage is reused by training and strategy-owned validation. Do not add a
validation-only callback for this.

```python
from nvalchemi.hooks import NeighborListHook
from nvalchemi.models.base import NeighborConfig
from nvalchemi.training import create_model_spec

hook_entry = {
    "spec": create_model_spec(
        NeighborListHook,
        config=NeighborConfig(cutoff=5.0),
    ).model_dump(mode="json"),
    "stages": ["BEFORE_FORWARD"],
}
```

Expect `spec report` to include warnings for common mistakes such as high
fine-tuning learning rates, missing validation data, unsafe checkpoint output
paths, or MACE compile settings.

## Choose The Entry Point

- Use `FineTuningStrategy(models=...)` when the user already loaded or built a
  trainable model.
- Use `FineTuningStrategy.from_pretrained_checkpoint(...)` to start a fresh
  fine-tuning run from model weights in a native nvalchemi checkpoint.
- Use `FineTuningStrategy.load_checkpoint(...)` only to resume an interrupted
  fine-tuning run with optimizer/scheduler/counters/hook state.

`from_pretrained_checkpoint` loads the complete checkpoint model set. A
single-model checkpoint becomes a single model input; multi-model checkpoints
preserve their named mapping. Source optimizer state, hooks, validation
settings, counters, and `num_epochs`/`num_steps` do not carry over. If the user
omits `loss_fn` or `optimizer_configs`, they may opt into source metadata with
`use_original_loss=True` or `use_original_opt_class=True`. Reused optimizer
configs get `optimizer_lr=1e-5` by default; pass `optimizer_lr=None` to keep the
checkpoint LR.

---

## Minimal Pattern

```python
loss_fn = EnergyMSELoss() + ForceMSELoss(normalize_by_atom_count=True)
loss_fn.dtype_policy = "prediction_to_target"  # optional dtype alignment

strategy = FineTuningStrategy(
    models=pretrained_model,
    trainable_patterns=("main.model.readout.*",),
    optimizer_configs=OptimizerConfig(
        optimizer_cls=torch.optim.AdamW,
        optimizer_kwargs={"lr": 3e-4, "weight_decay": 1e-6},
    ),
    training_fn=default_training_fn,
    loss_fn=loss_fn,
    validation_config=ValidationConfig(validation_data=val_loader, every_n_epochs=1),
    hooks=[CheckpointHook("runs/finetune/checkpoints", epoch_interval=1)],
    num_epochs=10,
)
strategy.run(train_loader)
```

Use low learning rates for full-model fine-tuning. Prefer `trainable_patterns`
for head-only or adapter-style workflows; patterns match fully qualified names
such as `"main.model.readout.weight"`.

---

## From A Native Checkpoint

Use this when a previous nvalchemi run produced a restartable checkpoint but the
new task should get fresh fine-tuning counters and optional source loss/optimizer
metadata.

```python
strategy = FineTuningStrategy.from_pretrained_checkpoint(
    "runs/pretrain/checkpoints",
    use_original_loss=True,
    use_original_opt_class=True,
    optimizer_lr=1e-5,
    training_fn=default_training_fn,
    trainable_patterns=("main.model.readout.*",),
    num_steps=2_000,
)
```

For multi-model checkpoints, write `training_fn(models, batch)` and pass
`optimizer_configs` keyed by the model(s) to update. Models omitted from
`optimizer_configs` are frozen/eval during training but can be used as teachers
or references. `use_original_loss` and `use_original_opt_class` require native
strategy metadata; they do not work with component-only checkpoints.

---

## Bring Your Own Model Or Foreign Checkpoint

Prefer native wrapper constructors for supported pretrained models, for example
`MACEWrapper.from_checkpoint(..., compile_model=False)`, because they preserve
reconstruction metadata for later strategy checkpoints. `compile_model=True` is
inference-only for MACE and freezes parameters.

For arbitrary PyTorch checkpoints:

- Instantiate the architecture through a wrapper class when possible.
- Use `create_model_spec(wrapper_cls_or_factory, ...)` for reproducible rebuilds.
- Load weights with `state_dict`; use `strict=False` only for intentional head or
  adapter changes and inspect missing/unexpected keys.
- If output keys differ from loss keys, write a `training_fn` that returns the
  mapping expected by the loss.
- Treat foreign checkpoints as weight imports, not restart checkpoints. Save a
  fresh `FineTuningStrategy` checkpoint before relying on resume behavior.

```python
state = torch.load(checkpoint_path, map_location="cpu", weights_only=True)
model.load_state_dict(state["model"] if "model" in state else state, strict=False)
model_spec = create_model_spec(MyWrapper.from_pretrained, checkpoint_path=str(checkpoint_path))
```

---

## Patch Or Freeze The Model

Use `module_patches` to replace or add child modules before optimizer
construction. Use `create_model_spec(...)` for patches that must serialize;
direct module instances are runtime-only.

```python
strategy = FineTuningStrategy(
    models=pretrained_model,
    module_patches={
        "main.model.readout": create_model_spec(
            torch.nn.Linear,
            in_features=128,
            out_features=1,
        )
    },
    freeze_patterns=("main.model.*",),
    trainable_patterns=("main.model.readout.*",),
    optimizer_configs=OptimizerConfig(optimizer_cls=torch.optim.AdamW),
    training_fn=default_training_fn,
    loss_fn=EnergyMSELoss(),
    num_steps=1_000,
)
```

`trainable_patterns` alone is an allow-list. `freeze_patterns` excludes broad
regions first, then `trainable_patterns` re-includes exceptions. Use
`freeze_mode="optimizer_only"` only when frozen parameters should still receive
gradients for diagnostics or custom hooks.

Typical strategies to fine-tune without catastrophic forgetting include
adding different readout/output heads or a new atom embedding table. Users
will likely need a way to route based on dataset. If the user does not specify
a strategy, discuss options tailored to the model and fine-tuning dataset.
Note that equivariant models like MACE will need specialized read-out layers
as to preserve equivariance.

## Caveats

- Check target/prediction units, atom ordering, neighbor-list assumptions, PBC,
  dtype, device, and output shapes before training. If label and model-output
  dtypes differ intentionally, make the user aware of `dtype_policy`: use
  `"prediction_to_target"` to cast outputs to labels or `"target_to_prediction"`
  to cast labels to outputs. Set it on a leaf loss, on `ComposedLossFunction(...)`,
  or as `loss_fn.dtype_policy = ...` after operator-sugar construction.
- Enable force/stress outputs in the model config when those losses need
  autograd-derived quantities.
- Start with validation and short checkpoint intervals; pretrained runs can
  regress quickly with mismatched data or too-large learning rates.
- Resume interrupted fine-tuning with `FineTuningStrategy.load_checkpoint`, not
  `from_pretrained_checkpoint`.
