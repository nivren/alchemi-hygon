"""JAX autograd wiring for per-pair distances and vectors.

Mirrors :mod:`nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors._autograd`.  The Warp launchers
do not propagate gradients across the JAX boundary (``enable_backward=False``
on every ``jax_kernel`` / ``jax_callable``), so the differentiable behaviour
is implemented entirely in pure JAX.

The Warp kernel determines only the *topology* — which pairs are neighbours,
with their integer atom indices and PBC shifts.  The differentiable geometry is
then **reconstructed in pure JAX** from that topology
(:func:`_reconstruct_pair_geometry`): ``r = positions[j] - positions[i] +
shifts @ cell``.  Because this is a plain JAX expression, gradients of *all
orders* (forces, Hessian / HVP) are handled natively and correctly for any
downstream loss — including losses nonlinear in distance.  (An earlier
``jax.custom_vjp`` straight-through that returned the detached kernel distances
and re-attached only a first-order gradient produced a wrong HVP whenever the
loss was nonlinear in distance; reconstructing live removes that failure mode.)

JIT compatibility constraint
----------------------------
JAX requires concrete bool indices, so this module keeps per-pair tensors at
the full ``(K, M)`` matrix shape (not the compact ``(P,)`` shape used on the
torch side).  Inactive slots are zeroed out via an ``active_mask`` instead of
being filtered with boolean indexing.
