# Benchmark Results

Pre-computed CSVs consumed by the Sphinx docs build. The shipped numbers
under this directory were produced on an **NVIDIA H100 80 GB HBM3
(Hopper)** and cover three modules (neighbor list, DFT-D3 dispersion,
electrostatics) across two chemical systems (CsCl, NH₃) and three
scaling modes.

The current snapshot was collected on 8 July 2026 under run ID
`b890cd6794884c1f9e9b143e104fa6da` and source fingerprint
`695f537dbf4dc6b6e33911363250f629af2629f489a38c583a27c5370373b770`.
Its 18 reportable CSVs contain all 3,504 planned rows: 3,404 successful
measurements and 100 explicit capacity-limit rows. The failures comprise 88
`OutOfMemoryError` rows, 9 strict-PME `JaxRuntimeError` rows, and 3
`SkippedAfterOOM` rows for JAX Ewald.

Every CSV embeds the same fingerprint in ``software_context``. The measured
source tree was clean at Git head
`66b2aa334a9f2d6b138bf0d1ee87da0e09055593`; later documentation-data edits do
not alter a timed kernel, callable, grid, or CSV value. The software context was
Python 3.13.9, Torch 2.12.0+cu126, JAX/JAXlib 0.9.0.1, Warp 1.13.0, CUDA 12.6,
and ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops 0.4.0. Collection used NVIDIA H100 80 GB HBM3 GPUs
(compute capability 9.0) with driver 535.216.03. A future kernel, public API,
timing-boundary, or grid change requires a complete replacement run.

See the per-module doc pages for how to read the plots and how to
reproduce:

- `../electrostatics.md`

## File naming

Names follow the scheme emitted by
`benchmarks.suite_utils.make_csv_name(module, system, mode)`:

```text
{module}-{system}-{mode-slug}.csv
```

Where `module` ∈ `{nl, d3, el}`, `system` ∈ `{cscl, nh3}`, and
`mode-slug` ∈ `{system-size-scaling, constant-workload-scaling,
batch-scaling}`. Example: `nl-cscl-system-size-scaling.csv`.

The current reportable NL/D3/EL suite uses only root-level `nl-*.csv`,
`d3-*.csv`, and `el-*.csv` files. Separate dynamics and segment-operation CSVs
may also remain at the root for their own docs pages. Outputs from the optional
extended electrostatics runner use `electrostatics_benchmark_*.csv` names and a
different schema; they are not read by the reportable plot generation path.

| `input_context` | JSON str | Content fingerprints for external NH3 and DFT-D3 inputs; absolute scratch paths are omitted |

When Torch and JAX runs share an output directory, each backend rerun replaces
only its own rows and preserves the other backend's rows after validating the
run, GPU, software, source, input, and per-backend runtime provenance.
Compatible scheduler shards may use different hosts and physical GPU UUIDs.
Backends contributing to the same CSV must use matching system filters; an
asymmetric filter can change the external-input fingerprint and is rejected
instead of being silently merged.
Failed, skipped, and OOM cases are
written directly into the main CSV with `success=False`; the plotter filters
those rows out. The suite no longer writes separate failure files.

The committed H100 CSVs use provenance schema version 2 and the current EL
energy-autograd contract. All 18 files share the run ID shown above; start a
fresh run directory and publish a complete replacement set for future reruns.

## Reproducing

Run from the repository root. Module-specific flags are documented on
each module's doc page; the flags below are common to all three reportable
runners. This standardized suite is the benchmark merge gate.

```bash
python -m benchmarks.neighborlist.benchmark_neighborlist \
    --config benchmarks/neighborlist/benchmark_config.yaml \
    --output-dir "$BENCHMARK_SCRATCH/results/manual-nl-run"
```

Swap in `benchmarks.interactions.dispersion.benchmark_dftd3` or
`benchmarks.interactions.electrostatics.benchmark_electrostatics_suite` for
the other modules, or invoke all three via the unified suite:

```bash
bash benchmarks/run_reportable_suite.sh \
    --output-dir "$BENCHMARK_SCRATCH/results/reportable-run"
```

The wrapper defaults to ``--backend all``: Torch and JAX run for NL, D3, and
electrostatics, and the direct Warp pass runs for NL. Use ``--backend both``
only when you intentionally want the two framework backends without Warp NL
rows.

Use a fresh directory for a new run. Pass `--resume` only to continue the run
already recorded there, or pass the same `--run-id` to parallel scheduler
shards; a mismatched run ID is rejected before execution.

Electrostatics has a separate optional surface:
`benchmark_electrostatics.py` uses `benchmark_config_extended.yaml` for
point-charge/slab/DSF studies and `benchmark_config_multipole.yaml` for
multipoles. It depends on additional benchmark packages not declared in the
project extras and does not write the reportable `el-*.csv` schema. Do not
substitute it for `benchmark_electrostatics_suite.py` in merge-gate commands.

The docs CSVs are reportable benchmark outputs: they use the full configured
grid, 3 warmups, and 10 timed runs unless an explicit command-line filter is
shown. Reduced smoke runs should write to a separate output directory.

The shipped H100 CSVs were collected sequentially through the regular Slurm
``batch`` queue, with one H100 active at a time. The final rows come from these
source-identical jobs:

| Job | Accepted scope | Host | Logged wall time |
|---|---|---|---:|
| `13573992` | Complete Torch/JAX suite, except three Torch NL shards replaced below | `pool0-01777` | 2 h 40 min 35 s |
| `13574007` | Warp NL, except the two batch-scaling shards replaced below | `pool0-01777` | 5 min 10 s |
| `13582160` | Fixed-affinity replacements for three Torch NL and two Warp NL shards; final validation | `pool0-01787` | 3 min 42 s |

The contributing jobs used 2 h 49 min 27 s of logged one-GPU time. Collection
ran from 06:39:28 to 09:58:00 PDT, a 3 h 18 min 32 s wall span including audit
and queue gaps, with peak concurrency of one H100. An intermediate whole-shard
rerun (`13581772`, 1 min 59 s) was fully superseded after the cross-run scaling
audit found that timing noise had moved to another point; it is not represented
in the published rows. The accepted replacement shards used one fixed logical
CPU to remove host scheduling noise. Final validation reported 3,504 planned
and emitted rows, and independent smoothness, endpoint, and prior-run
reproducibility checks found no remaining timing outliers.

CSV rows record steady-state per-benchmark timings. Scheduler time also includes
compilation, warmup, input loading, process startup, and cleanup.

For the JAX backend, pass `--backend jax`. Reportable runners preserve explicit
JAX/XLA settings, otherwise default the memory fraction to `0.95` while leaving
XLA's default preallocation policy in effect. The unified suite enables x64
before import because its electrostatics pass requires float64.
For D3 on offline clusters, pass `--d3-params-path` to a scratch-local
`dftd3_parameters.pt` file or pre-populate
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/nvalchemiops/dftd3_parameters.pt`.

## Visualization

Sphinx's generate_plots hook reads the standardized NL/D3/EL suite CSVs and
the separate dynamics CSV schema it knows how to parse, then writes PNGs to
`../_static/`. The benchmark pages embed those images.
